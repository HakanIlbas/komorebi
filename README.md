## What is Komorebi?

Komorebi is an awesome animated wallpapers manager for all Linux platforms.
It provides fully customizeable image, video, and web page wallpapers that can be tweaked at any time!

## Which change does this fork have compared to the original repository?

Well the original Komorebi repository used some functions of Gtk.Screen. Some of these were deprecated and thus not working correctly. However i looked at the deprecated functions in the vala documentations and there were replacements for them in Gtk.Display. In this fork i replaced Gtk.Screen by Gtk.Display. I confirmed it to be working on dual monitor setups with Ubuntu 18.04. I created this fork because the original developer of Komorebi was inactive for a long time and since there was no other solution available on the internet. Since this is a fork the packaged install does not have the changes i added to them, so I removed that tutorial from this readme. 

## How do I install Komorebi this forked version of Komorebi?

### Manual Installing (advanced)

Run the following:
```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:gnome3-team/gnome3 -y
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:vala-team -y
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:gnome3-team/gnome3-staging -y
sudo apt install cmake valac libgtk-3-dev libgee-0.8-dev libclutter-gtk-1.0-dev libclutter-1.0-dev libwebkit2gtk-4.0-dev libclutter-gst-3.0-dev
git clone https://github.com/HakanIlbas/komorebi.git
cd komorebi
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. && sudo make install && ./komorebi
```

## How do I create my own wallpaper?

Komorebi provides a simple tool to create your own wallpapers! Simply, open your apps and search for 'Wallpaper Creator'

![s1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cheesecakeufo/komorebi/master/screenshots/wallpaper_creator.jpg)

You can use either an image, a video, or a web page as a wallpaper and you have many different options to customize your very own wallpaper!

## Uninstall

### If you manually installed Komorebi

1. Open Terminal
2. `cd komorebi/build`
3. `sudo make uninstall`

## Questions? Issues?

### Will this fork actively resolve the issues of Komorebi

Maybe some of them, but definitely not all of them. I will probably also not add extra features to it. I only created this fork so more people can use it for whom it did not work. There was also no clear fix for the problem i tried to resolve in this fork.

### Komorebi is slow. What can I do about it?

Komorebi includes support for video wallpapers that might slow your computer down. You can disable support for video wallpapers in 'Desktop Preferences' â†’ uncheck 'Enable Video Wallpapers'.

_note: you need to quit and re-open Komorebi after changing this option_


### After uninstalling, my desktop isn't working right (blank or no icons)

The latest Komorebi should already have a fix for this issue. If you've already uninstalled Komorebi and would like to fix the issue, simply run this (in the Terminal):
`curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cheesecakeufo/komorebi/master/data/Other/postrm | bash -s`

If your issue has not already been reported, please report it *[`here`](https://github.com/cheesecakeufo/komorebi/issues/new)* and I'll try my best to fix them.

### Why does Komorebi install files in a macOS-like structure?

Komorebi was originally intended to run on an unreleased OS project. Since many people already use Komorebi, an update could potentially break Komorebi and custom-made wallpapers.

It is possible to change the file structure with code changes and a `postinst` script but I'd rather keep it as is for now or if you have the time to make one, feel free to do so and submit a PR!


## Status of Development

Komorebi still receives updates but they are not as frequent due to my involvement in other open-source projects.


### Thanks To:

Pete Lewis ([@PJayB](https://github.com/PJayB)) for adding mult-monitor support
